# Endorse - experiment

This repository is work in progress fork for
work on the Bukov 2 mine-by experiment.

Purpose is to quickly perform sensitivity analysis
of the HM prediction of pore pressures with respect to 
main input parameters.

The entrypoints are:
- src/endorse/Bukov2/*
- src/endorse/sa ... more consistent SA interface
- tests/Bukov2 ... tests of SALib and other specific tools

## How to compute
1. setup environment:
    ```
    bin/setup_venv
    ```
    That would recreate virtual environment from the scratch.
    On Charon, you need a Python module and you need the same module 
    on computing nodes. The simples way to deal with this entry constrain is to  
    add it into `.bashrc`:
    ```
    source /cvmfs/software.metacentrum.cz/modulefiles/5.1.0/loadmodules
    module load python/3.9.12-gcc-10.2.1-rg2lpmk
    ```

    PE virtual environment using container (suppose having image `endorse.sif`):
    ```
    singularity shell endorse.sif
    ./package/setup_venv_bayes.sh
    ```
    PE note:
    Currently (4.1.24) tested the whole computation chain inside singularity
    container with `venv_Bayes` environment without problem.
    Therefore, no module is needed. Working branch `PE_sens_2D`.

    TODO:
    - merge venv environments
    - merge configs
    - merge `PE_sens_2D` into `main`.

2. Plan and compute raw samples.

    Sampling itself is run by
    ```
    cd tests/Bukov2
    ./run_test_D02
    ```
    which calls `bin/endorse-bukov` which prepares sampling PBS jobs
    and depends on:
    - configuration file `3d_model/config_sim_D02hm.yaml`
    - template file `3d_model/D02_hm_tmpl.yaml`
    - gmsh mesh `3d_model/Bukov_both_h100_31k.msh2`

    PE The rest (3.4....) is gathered in shell script which can be run
    inside singularity container:
    ```
    qsub -I -q charon -l walltime=12:00:00 -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=20gb
    ...
    singularity shell endorse.sif
    cd tests/Bukov2
    ./run_postprocess
    ```

3. Collect samples.
    ```
    cd tests/Bukov2
    ./python collect_hdf.py <dir_with_hdfs>
    ```
    This would merge HDFs into single file and in the second phase 
    the complete sample groups are extracted. Few missing values are imputted 
    by the mean. Reduced dataset is formed for testing and debugging.

4. Compute field Sobol Total indices:
    ```
    cd tests/Bukov2
    ./python sobol_data.py <workdir>
    ```
    Expects: 
     `Bukov2_mesh.yaml` as cfg, and paths in `cfg.simulation`    
    - read raw pressure sample data
    - limit negative pressures by water vapour pressure at 10 degs
    - compute Sobol indices 
    - and pressure field characterization: mean, std; max, 90% quantile, median for range of pressure values

    Use an interactive job with plenty of RAM:

        qsub -I -q charon -l walltime=12:00:00 -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=20gb

5. Extract borehole data.
    ```
    cd tests/Bukov2
    ./python borehole_data.py <dir_with_hdfs>
    ```
    Workdir `<dir_with_hdfs>` must contain the cofig file `Bukov2_mesh.yaml`.
    For every borehole the sample data in discrete points are extracted. 
    Boreholes are in separate files under `workdir/borehole_data` in oredr to 
    simplify parallel processing.  

6. Borehole calculations.
   ```
    cd tests/Bukov2
    ./python process_boreholes.py <dir_with_hdfs> [submit] [i_bh]
   ```
   If `i_bh` is given, single borehole calculation:
   Borehole precalculation. 
   Borehole summary plot.
   Borehole packer optimization.
   
   If `submit` is given, submit PBS job for processing all boreholes.
   
   If only workdir is provided, run processing of all boreholes localy.
   
   Every borehole is processed in `<workdir>/process_bh_<i_bh>`
   The packer configuration results are stored there together with generated plots.

   Optimization of all boreholes writes the resulting list into 
7. Global measurement optimization.
## original Endorse readme for reference

The software implements specialized safety calculations for the excavation disturbed zone (EDZ)
of a deep repository of radioactive waste. It consists of two parts: 
1. determination of the rock parameters using the Bayesian inversion
2. stochastic prediction of the contamination transport and safety indicator evaluation

It essentially use the simulator [Flow123d](https://flow123d.github.io/) of processes in fractured rocks.

## Prerequisities

The software requires a working [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/) 
installation or [SingularityCE](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/quick_start.html) installation.
The first is better for local desktop usage, while the latter is usually the only option on HPC clusters. 
The use of clusters is recommended, as stochastic simulations are pretty computationally demanding. 
Currently, only the Linux installations are tested but should run 
with little effort on Windows due to containerization.


## Quick start

1. Download the latest version of the sources as a ZIP package.
2. Extract to the directory of your choice.
3. Set up the computational container with the proper environment using the `bin/endorse-setup` tool.
3. Create a working directory on a filesystem shared between computational nodes.
4. Prepare main configuration files.
5. Run Bayes inversion (`bin/endorse-bayes`) or stochastic transport (`bin/endorse-mlmc`).

See [full documentation](doc/main.md) for the details.

## Developers corner


### Repository structure:

- `doc` - software documentation and various reports from the Endorse project
- `experiments` - various numerical experiments and developments as part of the Endorse project
- `src` - main sources
- `tests` - various software tests, test data



### Development environment
In order to create the development environment run:

        setup.sh
        
As the Docker remote interpreter is supported only in PyCharm Proffesional, we have to debug most of the code just with
virtual environment and flow123d running in docker.
        
More complex tests should be run in the Docker image: [flow123d/geomop-gnu:2.0.0](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/flow123d/geomop-gnu)
In the PyCharm (need Professional edition) use the Docker plugin, and configure the Python interpreter by add interpreter / On Docker ...
